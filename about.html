      <p>"Prunella is a gifted postpartum doula. She provides a sense of calm, and helps moms to experience the joy of their newborn in those early, intimidating, sleep-deprived days of motherhood. She has researched-based knowledge and is full of practical mommy tips. She does what she promises to do, which is to help you feel confident as a mom and work herself out of a job. I am grateful to Lisa for providing me with the tools and solid foundation to be a great single mom." Stephanie C.</p>

      <p>"Prunella was FANTASTIC! Even after reading the stellar reviews, we didn't think that anyone or anything could help our 5-month old sleep through the night. But Prunella proved us wrong. After three nights with us, she had our daughter napping on a schedule and sleeping 11+ hours at night WITHOUT a pacifier. Prunella is worth every penny." Dora. M</p>
